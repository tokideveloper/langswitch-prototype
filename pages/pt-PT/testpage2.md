Another test page in pt-PT
==========================

This is another test page.
With that, I can test, too.

And [here][aaa] is a relative link to a page.

And [here][bbb] is an absolute link to a page.
And [here][bbb2] is another absolute link to a page.

And [here][ccc] is a relative link to the root directory of Doc.

And [here][ddd] is an absolute link to the root directory of Doc.
And [here][ddd2] is another absolute link to the root directory of Doc.

And [here][eee] is a relative link to the root directory.

And [here][fff] is an absolute link to the root directory.
And [here][fff2] is another absolute link to the root directory.

Have fun!
