Another test page
=================

This is another test page.
With that, I can test, too.

And [here][aaa] is a relative link to a page.

And [here][bbb] is an absolute link to a page.

And [here][ccc] is a relative link to the root directory of Doc.

And [here][ddd] is an absolute link to the root directory of Doc.

Have fun!

[aaa]: ../testpage1/
[bbb]: /doc/testpage1/
[ccc]: ../
[ddd]: /doc/
