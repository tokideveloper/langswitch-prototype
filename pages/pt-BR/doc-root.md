Doc root in pt-BR
=================

This is a test page.
With that, I can test the root directory of Doc.

And [here][aaa] is a relative link to a page.

And [here][bbb] is an absolute link to a page.
And [here][bbb2] is another absolute link to a page.

And [here][ccc] is a relative link to another page.

And [here][ddd] is an absolute link to another page.
And [here][ddd2] is another absolute link to another page.

And [here][eee] is a relative link to the root directory.

And [here][fff] is an absolute link to the root directory.
And [here][fff2] is another absolute link to the root directory.

Bye!
